[Team Charter]
The purpose of this team is to produce a game or level utalizing a Top-Down perseptive. 

So far our teams communication has been through email but we have other forms of contact if needed like text messaging through the phone.

We have been communicating every few days due to are busy schedules. It seems the weekend is a good time for us to figure out what to work on throughout the week.

[Project Vison and Goals]
The Project is in a Beta faze as the team is currently making plans and figuring out what we want to do for the final project.
The Project would be in its Alpha faze when the idea becomes more relized with a game and code being developed.

## Module Three Team Development: QA and Testing Plan
To test out our project we will assign a member to become a game tester. They will play the game to detect any errors or bugs the players could come into contact with. 

[How we should Test It? / Reported]
I believe it would be a good idea that every time the project is commited or updated to have the Game tester go through and mark down any problems they come across that can be fixed before the next commit. The Tester can make a word doc or an additional section in the ReadMe for the others in the team to seem exacatly what is wrong and where the problem occured. The Tester will not only have to check out the objects and levels made for the game but the code as one simple mistake can be disaterous to the development of the project.
//side note I have created an aditional file for the game tester to input any issues they run into so the whole team can view it.

[Schedule]
We will constantly play test the game during the preproduction to make sure the game runs smoothly. While we might miss some things like every game company in the world, we will create a Demo for players to test out and give feedback. This allows us to make changes and fix any problems before a full release.
